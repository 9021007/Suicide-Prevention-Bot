    "\"*Don't speak negatively about yourself, even as a joke. Your body doesn't know the difference. Words are energy and cast spells, that's why it's called spelling. Change the way you speak about yourself and you can change your life. What you're not changing, you're also choosing.\" -Bruce Lee*",
    "\"*Don't forget who you are and where you came from. Don't get too emotional over little things. Don't quit until you win the grand prize.\" -Robert Randle*",
    "\"*The epic story of tomorrow can't be written if it ends today.\" -Unknown*",
    "\"*Suicide is not an answer, it's destruction.\" -Al Green*",
